# Odin Landing Page

Welcome to my project! This is a part of [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com)'s foundations course. 

The goal of this project was to create a landing page for a website that matches a provided template. This was all done from scratch. I customized my landing page to represent a mental wellbeing website with a newsletter. The purpose of the landing page is to create interest to the customer and to call them to sign up for the newsletter. 

Please not that the images and certain sections of text that I used were generated by Large Language Models (ChatGPT). 

To check out my project, you can view the deployment through Github Pages or visit [my website](https://ajroman.com/odin-landing-page/)!
